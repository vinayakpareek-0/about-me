## Hi, I’m Vinayak

Machine Learning | Generative AI | NLP | AI Systems

I’m a B.Tech student specializing in Smart Manufacturing (AI/ML focus) at IIITDM Chennai. I build real-world AI systems — from classical ML pipelines to fine-tuned LLM agents and deployed inference services. My work focuses on taking models beyond experimentation into scalable, production-ready systems.

## What I Do

- End-to-end Machine Learning systems  
- Predictive Analytics and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) forecasting  
- NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Model deployment using FastAPI, Docker, and MongoDB  
- Production-ready pipelines and backend services

## Featured Projects

### OwlsAsk – Enterprise QA Agent

**Tech:** Llama 3.1 8B, QLoRA, Unsloth, FAISS, FastAPI, MongoDB, REST APIs  

- Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B using QLoRA to reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency.  
- Implemented two-stage training (SFT + DPO) to improve alignment and reduce hallucinations.  
- Built a production-level RAG pipeline integrating multiple knowledge sources with FAISS-based retrieval.  
- Designed backend APIs with FastAPI and integrated MongoDB for logging and system tracking.

### Predictive Maintenance ML System

**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Feature Engineering, ML Pipeline Design  

- Developed a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction model using NASA C-MAPSS turbofan dataset.  
- Engineered temporal degradation features and applied noise-resilient normalization across operating conditions.  
- Trained and optimized an XGBoost model with strong predictive performance.  
- Designed a modular and reproducible ML pipeline for experimentation and scalability.

## My Approach

I focus on building systems that solve real problems — not just achieving high scores in notebooks. Every project I publish is designed to be:

- Reproducible  
- Deployable  
- Clear and well-structured  
- Built using solid engineering practices

## What I’m Seeking

I am currently seeking Machine Learning or Generative AI internship opportunities where I can contribute to production-ready solutions, work on challenging real-world problems, and grow under real engineering constraints.
