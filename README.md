 ## 👋 Hi, I’m Vinayak 

Machine Learning | Generative AI | NLP | AI Systems

I’m a B.Tech student specializing in Smart Manufacturing and AI/ML at IIITDM Chennai. I build real-world AI systems — from ML pipelines to fine-tuned LLM agents and deployed inference services.


### What I Do
	•	End-to-end Machine Learning systems
	•	Predictive Analytics & RUL forecasting
	•	NLP & Large Language Models (LLMs)
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	•	Model deployment with FastAPI, Docker, MongoDB
	•	Production-ready pipelines & backend services


### Featured Projects

#### OwlsAsk – Enterprise QA Agent

Tech: Llama 3.1 8B, QLoRA, Unsloth, FAISS, FastAPI, MongoDB, REST APIs
	•	Fine-tuned LLM with QLoRA to reduce memory use and speed up inference.
	•	Applied two-stage training (SFT + DPO) to improve response quality.
	•	Built a production-level RAG pipeline with multi-source retrieval.
	•	Deployed backend API and integrated with databases for real usage.

#### Predictive Maintenance ML System

Tech: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Feature Engineering, Pipeline Design
	•	Built Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction model using NASA turbofan dataset.
	•	Engineered temporal degradation features and noise-resilient normalization.
	•	Achieved high prediction accuracy with scalable ML pipeline.

### Tech Stack

Languages: Python, C++, C, JavaScript
ML & AI: PyTorch, Hugging Face, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, FastAI
LLMs: QLoRA, RLHF, DPO, FAISS, RAG
Deployment: FastAPI, Docker, MongoDB
Tools: Git, VS Code, LangChain



### My Approach

I focus on building systems that solve real problems — not just achieving high scores in notebooks. Every project I publish is meant to be:
	•	reproducible
	•	deployable
	•	understandable by others
	•	built with best practices

### What I’m Seeking

Looking for Machine Learning / Generative AI internships where I can contribute to production-ready solutions, solve high-impact challenges, and grow under real engineering constraints.
